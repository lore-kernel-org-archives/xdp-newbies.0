Notice, there are two mailing lists (Cc'ed) that you should likely ask
these kind of questions on (instead of netdev), depending on if this is
mostly related to bpf (iovisor-dev@lists.iovisor.org) or somehow
related to XDP (xdp-newbies@vger.kernel.org).

You obviously cannot call printk directly from and eBPF program.
I wonder how you got this compiling...

As you hinted yourself, you should be using: bpf_trace_printk().
But it is actually tricky to use... and not much help is around to
figure this out.

First of all the output end-up in this file: /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe
Remember to read the output use 'cat' like:

 sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe

And only the first process to read the output gets the output...


I deduct you are using the TC/iproute2 examples:
 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/tree/examples/bpf

Next gotcha is that, you need to provide the char* string in a very
special way to make this compile correctly.  The iproute2 provide a
helper define called "printt()" in include/bpf_api.h for this:

#ifndef printt
# define printt(fmt, ...)                                               \
        ({                                                              \
                char ____fmt[] = fmt;                                   \
                trace_printk(____fmt, sizeof(____fmt), ##__VA_ARGS__);  \
        })
#endif

Or see my solution here:
[1] https://github.com/netoptimizer/prototype-kernel/blob/master/kernel/samples/bpf/xdp_ddos01_blacklist_kern.c#L86:L99


Another gotcha I've experienced is that if you format the string
incorrectly, or use a modifier like %X, which bpf_trace_printk() does
not seem to understand, then you "hear-nothing"...  Also experienced if
using more than 3 arguments, then it fails or also go silent. Be
careful when using this somewhat "flaky" debug facility.

Do remember these bpf_trace_printk() should only be used for debugging,
as it is very slow...
