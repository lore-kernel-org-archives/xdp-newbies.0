I have been looking at this approach, which is close to option #3 above.

The problem with your implementation that you use a per-cpu store.
This creates the problem of storing state between packets. First packet
can call helper bpf_xdp_redirect() setting an ifindex, but program can
still return XDP_PASS.  Next packet can call XDP_REDIRECT and use the
ifindex set from the first packet.  IMHO this is a problematic API to
expose.

I do see that the TC interface that uses the same approach, via helper
bpf_redirect().  Maybe it have the same API problem?  Looking at
sch_handle_ingress() I don't see this is handled (e.g. by always
clearing this_cpu_ptr(redirect_info)->ifindex = 0).

I'll take a closer look. I don't think we need the per-cpu-store
approach for XDP, as we might as well store the port info in xdp_buff,
or return it directly option #1.

(TC redirect need the per-cpu-store to avoid extending the SKB).

I would still like people to comment on the above options?
