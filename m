I agree, it is not good to add this kind of logic to the kernel. We
would create too many funny race conditions with userspace.

We still don't have a good place for XDP documentation.  My own[1]
attempt have gotten out-of-sync, and I need to restructure the
rst-docs, before I want to propose it for the kernel.

[1] https://prototype-kernel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/networking/XDP/index.html

I want to create some samples/examples with XDP_REDIRECT, that
highlight this property.  Maybe the samples/bpf/xdp_redirect{,_map}
should automatically attach a XDP bpf_prog to the egress device?
