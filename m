hmm I must be missing something, bpf_redirect() helper should be used as a
return statement, e.g.

	return bpf_redirect(ifindex, flags);

Its a bit awkward to use in any other way. You would have to ensure the
program returns TC_ACT_REDIRECT in all cases I presume. It seems incredibly
fragile and gains nothing as far as I can tell. bpf_redirect uses per_cpu
data and expects the core to call skb_do_redirect() to push the packet into
the correct netdev. bpf_redirect() does not modify the skb->ifindex value,
looking at the code now.

Are you suggesting using xdp_md to store the ifindex value instead of a per
cpu variable in the redirect helper? Do you really mean the xdp_md struct in
the uapi headers? I don't see why it needs to be in the UAPI at all. If we
don't like per cpu variables it could be pushed as part of xdp_buff I guess.

My suggestion is we could add an ifindex to the xdp_md structure and have the
receiving NIC driver populate the value assuming it is useful to programs. But,
if we use cls_bpf as a model then xdp_md ifindex is more or less independent of
the redirect helper. In my opinion we should avoid diverging cls bpf and xdp bpf
in subtle ways like handling of ifindex and redirect.

Agreed on all this further optimization would be welcome of course after
basic implementation is in place.
