When I wrote this I assumed some user space piece could
load the "dummy" nop program on devices as needed. It seemed
easier than putting semi-complex logic in the kernel to load
programs on update_elem, but only if the user hasn't already
loaded a program and then unload it but again only if some
criteria is met. Then we would have one more kernel path into
load/unload BPF programs and would need all the tests and what
not.

+1 for documenting and userland usability patches.
