With XDP_REDIRECT we must "just free the buffer" in ixgbe this means
page_frag_free() on the data. There is no way to know where the xdp
buffer came from it could be a different NIC for example.

However with how ixgbe is coded up recycling will work as long as
the memory is free'd before the driver ring tries to use it again. In
normal usage this should be the case. And if we are over-running a device
it doesn't really hurt to slow down the sender a bit.

I think this is a pretty good model, we could probably provide a set
of APIs for drivers to use so that we get some consistency across
vendors here, ala Jesper's page pool ideas.

(+Alex, for ixgbe details)

Thanks,
