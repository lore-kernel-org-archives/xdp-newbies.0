Gotcha-3 (quoted above) is an interesting problem.  At first it looks
like a driver tuning problem. But it is actually an inherent property
of XDP, as there is no-queue or push-back flow control with XDP, there
is no way to handle TX queue overrun.
 My proposed solution: I want to provide a facility for userspace to
load another eBPF program (at the tracepoint xdp_redirect), which can
"see" the issue occurring.  This allows a XDP/BPF developer to
implement their own reaction/mitigation flow-control (e.g. via a map
shared with the XDP program).

I think you are referring to Gotcha-2 here:

  Second gotcha(2): you cannot TX out a device, unless it also have a
  xdp bpf program attached. (This is an implicit dependency, as the
  driver code need to setup XDP resources before it can ndo_xdp_xmit).

Yes, we should work on improving this situation.  Auto enabling XDP
when a netdev is added to a devmap is a good solution.  Currently this
is tied to loading an XDP bpf_prog.  Do you propose loading a dummy
bpf_prog on the netdev? (then we need to handle 1. not replacing
existing bpf_prog, 2. on take-down don't remove "later" loaded
bpf_prog).
