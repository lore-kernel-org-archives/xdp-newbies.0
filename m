I love this idea. Integrating the port table closer with the bpf-maps
infrastructure makes sense.  This gives me a place to hook the code into,
instead of (re)inventing a new infrastructure for this port table, and the
interface will be more natural from a bpf-API point of view.

When registering/attaching a XDP/bpf program, we would just send the
file-descriptor for this port-map along (like we do with the bpf_prog
FD). Plus, it own ingress-port number this program is in the port-map.

It is not clear to me, in-which-data-structure on the kernel-side we
store this reference to the port-map and ingress-port. As today we only
have the "raw" struct bpf_prog pointer. I see several options:

1. Create a new xdp_prog struct that contains existing bpf_prog,
a port-map pointer and ingress-port. (IMHO easiest solution)

2. Just create a new pointer to port-map and store it in driver rx-ring
struct (like existing bpf_prog), but this create a race-challenge
replacing (cmpxchg) the program (or perhaps it's not a problem as it
runs under rcu and RTNL-lock).

3. Extend bpf_prog to store this port-map and ingress-port, and have a
fast-way to access it.  I assume it will be accessible via
bpf_prog->bpf_prog_aux->used_maps[X] but it will be too slow for XDP.
