I completely agree -- I just noted that the offset would be -20 in the
tx_tunnel case and it's easy to get confused since a positive int for
the second arg in skb_pull() does go 'back' with a positive value  and
was just rebuilding and testing just this case with:

-	off = xdp.data - orig_data;
+	/* note that offset is negative */
+	off = orig_data - xdp.data;

This should do it.  I'll give that run, too.
