Nice! Thanks for testing.

The missed packets are probably due to xmit queue being full.
We need 'xdp_tx_full' counter in:
+       if (free_skb) {
+               trace_xdp_exception(dev, xdp_prog, XDP_TX);
+               kfree_skb(skb);
+       }
like in-driver xdp does.
It's surprising that tx becomes full so often. May be bnxt specific behavior?
