Yes, I would really like to see an API like this.

Yes, exactly, return to the input device. I really think we should
work on a solution where we can keep the DMA mapping around.  We have
an opportunity here to make ndo_xdp_xmit TX queues use a specialized
page return call, to achieve this. (I imagine other arch's have a high
DMA overhead than Intel)

I'm not sure how the API should look.  The ixgbe recycle mechanism and
splitting the page (into two packets) actually complicates things, and
tie us into a page-refcnt based model.  We could get around this by
each driver implementing a page-return-callback, that allow us to
return the page to the input device?  Then, drivers implementing the
1-packet-per-page can simply check/read the page-refcnt, and if it is
"1" DMA-sync and reuse it in the RX queue.
