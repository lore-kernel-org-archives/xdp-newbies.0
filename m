I'm not sure how you think that would work - at least with our (wifi)
driver, the headlen should be maybe ETH_HLEN or so at this point. We'd
let the program know that it can only look at so much, but then the
program can't do anything at all with those frames. At some point then
we go back to bpf_skb_load_bytes() being necessary in one form or
another, no?
