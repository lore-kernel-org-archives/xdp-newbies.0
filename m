Yeah, based on Alex' description, it's not clear to me whether ixgbe
redirecting to a non-intel NIC or vice versa will actually work.  It
sounds like the output device has to make some assumptions about how
the page was allocated by the input device.  With buffer return API,
each driver can cleanly recycle or free its own buffers properly.

Let me discuss this further with Andy to see if we can come up with a
good scheme.
