yeah. tailcall is not a special opcode from user space point of view.
Only after normal call with func_id=bpf_tail_call passes verifier
then verifier will change insn->code into CALL|X
It's done only to have two 'case' statement in the interpreter,
so that normal calls and tailcalls don't interfere.
 From user space pov CALL|X opcode is reserved and we can use it
for something in the future. Just need to change interpeter and JITs.

tried this diff. It looks better
   10:	7b 1a f8 ff 00 00 00 00 	stdw	[r1+-8], r10
   18:	79 a1 f8 ff 00 00 00 00 	lddw	r10, [r1+-8]
I wonder if '+' can be removed as well.

'-g' still doesn't seem to work:
/w/binutils-gdb/bld/binutils/objdump: invalid relocation type 10
/w/binutils-gdb/bld/binutils/objdump: BFD (GNU Binutils)
