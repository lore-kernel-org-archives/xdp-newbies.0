Hmm, you can do that already today with bpf_xdp_event_output() helper
and the program decides when to sample and what custom meta data to
prepend along with the (partial or full) xdp packet, see also [1], slide
11 for the "XDP dump" part.

No need to change drivers for this, psample_sample_packet() would also
be slower.
