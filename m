It would be a helpful (follow-on) optimization for packets that do
pass through it. It allows skb recycling with napi_reuse_skb and can
be used to protect if a vulnerability in the gro stack pops up.

That limiter is for egress redirecting to egress, I believe. This
ingress to egress will go through netif_rx and a softirq if looping.

Another point on redirect is clearing skb state. queue_mapping and
sender_cpu will be dirty, but should be able to handle it. It seems
possible to attach to a virtual device, such as a tunnel. In that case
the packet may have gone through a complex receive path before
reaching the tunnel, including tc ingress, so even more skb fields may
be set (e.g., priority). The same holds for act_mirred or
__bpf_redirect, so I assume that this is safe.
