right. these things need to be taken care of.
Technically for ndo_xdp_xmit to work the program doesn't need
to be attached, but the device needs to be in xdp mode with
configured xdp tx rings.
The easiest, of course, is just to document it :)
and may be add some sort of warning that if netdev is added
to devmap and it's not in xdp mode, return warning or error.
