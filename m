In theory, yes, but in practice I doubt it will be so easy.
We probably shouldn't allow very different types of netdev
into the same netdev_array or port_array (whatever the name).
They need to be similar enough, otherwise we'd have to do run-time
checks. If they're all the same, these checks can be done at
insertion time instead.

don't know :)
we need to brainstorm pros and cons.

hmm. didn't think that far either :)
indeed makes sense to pass 'ctx' into such helper as well,
so it's easier to deal with original netdev.

makes sense to me as well.
Ideally we should try to make an api such, that batching or no-batching
can be kernel choice. The program will just do
xdp_tx_port(...something here...)
and the kernel does the best for performance. If it needs to delay
the result to do batching the api should allow that transparently.
Like right now xdp program does 'return XDP_TX;' and
on the kernel side we can either do immediate xmit (like we do today)
or can change it to do batching and programs don't need to change.

absolutely!
bpf_tx_allports() should somehow exclude the port packet arrived on.
What you're proposing about passing 'ctx' into this helper,
should solve it, I guess.

awesome :) Let's brainstorm more and get John's opinion on it as well,
since sounds like he'll be heavy user of such api.
