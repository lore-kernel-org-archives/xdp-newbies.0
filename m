Yep and I'm not sure I follow :)

I'm not sure I understand the "lives inside the kernel" bit. I assumed
the 'map' should be a bpf map and behave like any other bpf map.

I wanted a new map to be defined, something like this from the bpf programmer
side.

struct bpf_map_def SEC("maps") port_table =
	.type = BPF_MAP_TYPE_PORT_CONNECTION,
	.key_size = sizeof(u32),
	.value_size = BPF_PORT_CONNECTION_SIZE,
	.max_entries = 256,
};

So the user space application that is loading the program also needs
to handle this map. This seems correct to me. But I don't see the
value in making some new port table when we already have well understood
framework for maps.

I think the above optimization should be allowed. And agree multiple port
tables (maps?) is needed. Again all this points to using standard maps
logic in my mind. For permissions and different domains, which I think
you were starting to touch on, it looks like we could extend the pinning API.
At the moment it does an inode_permission(inode, MAY_WRITE) check but I
presume this could be extended. None of this would be needed in v1 and
could be added subsequently. read-only maps seems doable.
