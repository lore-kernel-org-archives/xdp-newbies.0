So I tried a variety of things and the simplest change on top of yours that
works well for xdp1, xdp2, and xdp_tx_iptunnel.

I ran this on top of a card that uses the bnxt_en driver on a desktop
class system with an i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, sending a single stream of
UDP traffic with flow control disabled and saw the following (all stats
in Million PPS).

                xdp1                xdp2            xdp_tx_tunnel
Generic XDP      7.8    5.5 (1.3 actual)         4.6 (1.1 actual)
Optimized XDP   11.7		     9.7                      4.6

One thing to note is that the Generic XDP case shows some different
results for reported by the application vs actual (seen on the wire).  I
did not debug where the drops are happening and what counter needs to be
incremented to note this -- I'll add that to my TODO list.  The
Optimized XDP case does not have a difference in reported vs actual
frames on the wire.

I agree with all those who have asserted that this is great tool for
those that want to get started with XDP but do not have hardware, so I'd
say it's ready to have the 'RFC' tag dropped.  Thanks for pushing this
forward, Dave!  :-)
