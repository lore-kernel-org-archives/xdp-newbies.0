I was away from my keyboard for a few days, but was able to get some
time to test this today.

When using this change above suggested by Alexei, XDP_DROP and XDP_TX
actions appear to work well with xdp1 and xdp2.

I'm seeing some rather odd behavior with xdp_tx_tunnel so it might be
good to hold off on committing this just yet.

At first glance, it looks like there is enough headroom for the new
frame, but the resulting packet data do not look right and I'm actually
seeing some data that may be left on the stack from a previous caller.
