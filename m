Cool, I will do that. Then, I'll also have a redirect method to shape
this around, and I would have to benchmark/test your ixgbe redirect.

(John please let me know, what github tree we are talking about, and
what branch)

(This is difficult to explain without us misunderstanding each-other)

As Alexei also mentioned before, ifindex vs port makes no real
difference seen from the bpf program side.  It is userspace's
responsibility to add ifindex/port's to the bpf-maps, according to how
the bpf program "policy" want to "connect" these ports.  The
port-table system add one extra step, of also adding this port to the
port-table (which lives inside the kernel). 

When loading the XDP program, we also need to pass along a port table
"id" this XDP program is associated with (and if it doesn't exists you
create it).  And your userspace "control-plane" application also need
to know this port table "id", when adding a new port.

The concept of having multiple port tables is key.  As this implies we
can have several simultaneous "data-planes" that is *isolated* from
each-other.  Think about how network-namespaces/containers want
isolation. A subtle thing I'm afraid to mention, is that oppose to the
ifindex model, a port table with mapping to a net_device pointer, would
allow (faster) delivery into the container's inner net_device, which
sort of violates the isolation, but I would argue it is not a problem
as this net_device pointer could only be added from a process within the
namespace.  I like this feature, but it could easily be disallowed via
port insertion-time validation.

Yes, this xdpdump sound like a very useful tool.
