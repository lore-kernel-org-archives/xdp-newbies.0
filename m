Technically, once you know the capability of the *driver*, the verifier
should be able to check if the *program* is compatible. So if the
driver can guarantee "you always get 2k accessible", the verifier can
check that you don't access more than xdb->data + 2047, similar to how
it verifies that you don't access beyond xdb->data_end.

I agree with this though, it's not reasonable to have wildly varying
implementations here that may or may not be able to access almost
anything. The totally degenerate case would be having no skb header at
all, which is also still entirely valid from the network stack's POV.

Like I said above, I think this is something that you can possibly
determine in the verifier.

So if, for example, the verifier notices that the program never
accesses anything but the first few bytes, then it would seem valid to
run with only that much pulled into the skb header.

OTOH, it might depend on the frame data itself, if the program does
something like

xdp->data[xdp->data[0] & 0xf]

(read or write, doesn't really matter) so then the verifier would have
to take the maximum possible value there into account.
