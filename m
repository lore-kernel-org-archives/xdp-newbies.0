Yes, this is excellent.  I'm not all the way thru it, but I looked at
the data and corroborate the results you are seeing.

My results for both optimized and generic XDP for
xdp_bench01_mem_access_cost --action XDP_DROP --readmem are quite
similar to yours (11.7Mpps and 7.8Mpps, respectively for me 11.7Mpps and
8.4Mpps for you).

I also noted (as you did) that there is no discernible difference
running xdp_bench01_mem_access_cost with or without the --readmem
option since the packet data is already being accessed that late it the
stack.

Sorry for the delayed response.  I was AFK yesterday, but based on
testing from Friday and what I wrapped up today all looks good to me.

On my system (i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz) the reported and actual TX
throughput for xdp_tx_iptunnel is 4.6Mpps for the optimized XDP.

For generic XDP the reported throughput of xdp_tx_iptunnel is 4.6Mpps
but only ~880kpps actually on the wire.  It seems to me that can be
fixed with a follow-up for offending drivers or the stack if deemed that
there is a real error there.

Agreed.
