I'll get an arm board up and running to do some testing there.  As a
teaser:

  Test run by aconole on Fri Apr 28 11:52:18 2017
  Target is bpf-linux-elf
  Host   is x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

  		=== gas tests ===

  ...
  Running /home/aconole/git/binutils-gdb/gas/testsuite/gas/bfin/error.exp ...
  Running /home/aconole/git/binutils-gdb/gas/testsuite/gas/bpf/bpf.exp ...
  Running /home/aconole/git/binutils-gdb/gas/testsuite/gas/cfi/cfi.exp ...
  ...

And also:

  11:56:08 aconole {master} ~/git/binutils-gdb$ ./binutils/objdump -dr move.o

  move.o:     file format elf64-bpfle


  Disassembly of section .text:

  0000000000000000 <.text>:
     0:	bf 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 	mov	r1, r2

    48:	b7 50 00 00 02 00 00 00 	mov	r5, 2

This is on an intel i7 (so not terribly exotic)
