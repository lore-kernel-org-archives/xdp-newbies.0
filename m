Ok, what about stack usage?

Currently if I don't see a reference to FP then I elide allocating
MAX_BPF_STACK stack space.

What if, with tail calls, some programs need that stack space whilst
other's done?

It looks like, for example, JITs like powerpc avoids this issue
because they allocate the full MAX_BPF_STACK all the time.  That seems
like overkill to me and bad for cache locality.
