I'm not sure I completely follow the 3 proposals.
Are you suggesting to have only one netdev_array per program?
Why not to allow any number like we do for tailcall+prog_array, etc?
We can teach verifier to allow new helper
bpf_tx_port(netdev_array, port_num);
to only be used with netdev_array map type.
It will fetch netdevice pointer from netdev_array[port_num]
and will tx the packet into it.
We can make it similar to bpf_tail_call(), so that program will
finish on successful bpf_tx_port() or
make it into 'delayed' tx which will be executed when program finishes.
Not sure which approach is better.

We can also extend this netdev_array into broadcast/multicast. Like
bpf_tx_allports(&netdev_array);
call from the program will xmit the packet to all netdevices
in that 'netdev_array' map type.

The map-in-map support can be trivially extended to allow netdev_array,
then the program can create N multicast groups of netdevices.
Each multicast group == one netdev_array map.
The user space will populate a hashmap with these netdev_arrays and
bpf kernel side can select dynamically which multicast group to use
to send the packets to.
bpf kernel side may look like:
struct bpf_netdev_array *netdev_array = bpf_map_lookup_elem(&hash, key);
if (!netdev_array)
   ...
if (my_condition)
    bpf_tx_allports(netdev_array);  /* broadcast to all netdevices */
else
    bpf_tx_port(netdev_array, port_num); /* tx into one netdevice */

that's an artificial example. Just trying to point out
that we shouldn't restrict the feature too soon.
