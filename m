yeah, when netdev is being unregistered we have to drop the ref
to avoid the warning.

Speaking of delete notifiers for maps.
Until recently all deletions were explicit and the program
could do extra perf_event_submit() if it needed to notify
user space of deletion.
But right now we have LRU map that deletes automatically and this
netdev_array will be deleting automatically too, so we probably
need some sort of generic map notifier for all map types.
It can be as simple as user space sleeping on read(map_fd, buf);
or waiting for epoll on map_fd and kernel wakes it up
when map element is deleted and pushes 'key/value' pair
into the buf. That should be generic for all map types,
but it needs some mechanism to avoid blocking, since number
of deletions can be huge. Something similar to perf's event record
'lost N records' should do the trick.
