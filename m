perfect.
I think we should try to make all additions to bpf networking world
to be usable for both tc and xdp, since both are actively used and
it wouldn't be great to have cool feature for one, but not the other.
I think port table is an excellent candidate that applies to both.

I think lack of tcpdump-like debugging in xdp is a separate issue.
As I was saying in the other thread we have trivial 'xdpdump' kern+user
app that emits pcap file, but it's too specific to how we use
tail_calls+prog_array in our xdp setup. I'm working on the program
chaining that will be generic and allow us transparently add multiple
xdp or tc progs to the same attachment point and will allow us to
do 'xdpdump' at any point of this pipeline, so debugging of what
happened to the packet will be easier and done in the same way
for both tc and xdp.
btw in our experience working with both tc and xdp the tc+bpf was
actually harder to use and more bug prone.
