ahh. i thought all drivers do at least copy-break (256) bytes or copy
get_headlen or build_skb the whole thing.
Since wireless does eth_hlen, then yeah, skb_linearize() is the only way.
I guess any driver that would care about XDP performance would either
implement in-driver XDP or make sure that skb_linearize() doesn't
happen in generic XDP by doing build_skb() with the whole packet.
The driver can be smart and avoid doing copy-break if generic XDP is on.
