We do copy-break, but that's only applicable when there's no non-linear 
data left afterwards :)

It's rather difficult to do this in wifi because we'd need to parse
deep into the packet - at a point where we haven't even parsed the
802.11 header (which has variable length) fully.

So that leaves us to do it at the very end, after conversion to
ethernet format, but then it feels pointless since we might as well let
the rest of the stack do it.

Indeed. I think this is less about performance than ease of
experimentation.
