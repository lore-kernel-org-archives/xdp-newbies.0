We could use skb_cow() for this purpose, which deals with cloning as
well as enforcing headroom.

However, thinking further about this, the goal is to make generic XDP
match precisely how in-driver-XDP behaves.  Therefore, such redirects
from act_mirred would never flow through the XDP path.

No other possibility can cause us to see a cloned packet here, we
are before network taps are processed, etc.  So in my opinion the
thing to do is to elide generic XDP if the SKB is cloned.
