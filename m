yes. I'm bringing it up only to hopefully find cases where this
generic XDP can be used for real data path too (and not only experimentation).
Like if it can do 6Mpps whereas in-driver XDP will do 20Mpps (when implemented),
for some folks it may be good enough already to start using it.
Which will put more pressure on NIC vendor to implement it.
