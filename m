I think we do.

I completely agree.

I'm not so sure about that.

This is why Andy's tests aren't working properly, good find.

Yep.

I completely overlooked the fact that the MAC header was pulled
by the time we get here already.

Yes it will be useful for debugging.

Andy already ran into this, he wanted to test it with a driver
that supports XDP so he had to comment out the driver's ndo op.

Indeed, this will be very valuable.
