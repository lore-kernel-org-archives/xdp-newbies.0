So my preference would be (2) rather than (1). The simple reason being
that I would prefer it if we didn't have every driver doing their own
memory management API. With that said though I realize we need to have
a solid proof-of-concept before we can get there so I am okay with
each driver doing their own thing until we have a clear winner of some
sort in all these discussions.

The biggest issue I see with (1) is that it assumes that the Tx should
somehow be responsible for the recycling. The whole thing ends up
being way too racy. The problem is you will have two drivers sharing a
region of memory and each will have to do some sort of additional
reference counting if not using the existing page count. The result is
you can have either the Rx device needing to free resources which will
have to somehow be tracked from the Rx side, and the Tx side will have
to handle the freeing and dumping the packet back into the Rx pool if
it is the Tx that needs to free the resources. The standard case in
this gets messy, but the exception cases such as removing or resetting
a driver can get messy quickly.
