hmm. port table cannot sandbox the ports. The only thing it does
from 'safety' point of view is moving the checks from run-time into
static insertion time.
So the checks that we would do on netdev after looking it up
based on ifindex are the same checks we will do at insertion time
into port table. The user space will insert/delete them live
from that port table, so from program point of view it's exactly
the same as ifindex. The ports can disappear and can be added
while the program is running.

Note the very first bpf patchset years ago contained the port table
abstraction. ovs has concept of vports as well. These two very
different projects needed port table to provide a layer of
indirection between ifindex==netdev and virtual port number.
This is still the case and I'd like to see this port table to be
implemented for both cls_bpf and xdp. In that sense xdp is not special.

not true. when bpf_redirect() drops the packet due to incorrect ifindex
that packet disappears without a trace. No tcpdump and no counter.
And this is fine. We can add tracepoint there for debugging,
but it wasn't a problem for anyone who's using it today, so it's
'nice to have', but certainly not mandatory.
