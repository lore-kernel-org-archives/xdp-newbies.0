You could, it is just added complexity. "just free the buffer" in
ixgbe usually just amounts to one atomic operation to decrement the
total page count since page recycling is already implemented in the
driver. You still would have to unmap the buffer regardless of if you
were recycling it or not so all you would save is 1.000015259 atomic
operations per packet. The fraction is because once every 64K uses we
have to bulk update the count on the page.

There are still thoughts at some point in the future to consider
changing the layout so that we lay things out linearly instead of
interleaving the page halves. However that is a bit of optimization
and right now I don't really have the spare time to explore it. It
would help the performance by making sure the pages are warm on the
second freeing assuming all the packets in a given flow are received
back to back.
