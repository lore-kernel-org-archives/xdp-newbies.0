yeah. let's keep redirect to sockets, tunnels, crypto and exotic things
out of this discussion.
XDP_REDIRECT should assume L2 raw packet is being redirected to another L2 netdev.
If we make it too generic it will lose performance.

For cls_bpf the ifindex concept is symmetric. The program can access it as
skb->ifindex on receive and can redirect to another ifindex via bpf_redirect() helper.
Since netdev is not locked, it's actually big plus, since container management
control plane can simply delete netns+veth and it goes away. The program can
have dangling ifindex (if control plane is buggy and didn't update the bpf side),
but it's harmless. Packets that redirect to non-existing ifindex are dropped.
This approach already understood and works well, so for XDP I suggest to use
the same approach initially before starting to reinvent the wheel.
struct xdp_md needs ifindex field and xdp_redirect() helper that redirects
to L2 netdev only. That's it. Simple and easy.
I think the main use cases in John's and Jesper's minds is something like
xdpswitch where packets are coming from VMs and from physical eths and
being redirected to either physical eth or to VM via upcoming vhost+xdp support.
This xdp_md->ifindex + xdp_redirect(to_ifindex) will solve it just fine.

Once we have vhost+xdp and all other bits implemented, we must come back
to this discussion about having port mapping table. As I mentioned
during netconf I think it's very useful, but I don't think we should
gate vhost+xdp and xdp_redirect work on this discussion.
As far as this port mapping table we would need 'port' field in xdp_md as well
and xdp_redirect_port() done via helper or via extra 'out_port' field in xdp_md
plus another XDP_REDIRECT_PORT action code.
The actual port table (array) should be populated by user space with netdevs
and these netdev will have their refcnt incremented. Then we'll have discussion
what to do with netdev_unregister notifiers, whether they should be auto-removed
from port table or bpf should have a chance to be notified and act on it.
Such port mapping will allow us to optimize inevitable call
dev_get_by_index_rcu(dev_net(skb->dev), ri->ifindex);
away, since netdevs will be stored in the port table and direct deref
port_map_array[xdp_md->out_port] will give us target netdev quickly.
It's nice optimization and there are other more powerful optimizations we
can do with such port table (since we will know in advance which netdevs
the program will be redirecting too), but I still think we should do
ifindex based xdp_redirect first and only add this port table later.
