We basically do that automatically in netdev_wait_allrefs:

pr_emerg("unregister_netdevice: waiting for %s to become free. Usage
count = %d\n",
         dev->name, refcnt);

It is a very unpleasant warning and users probably think about a bug in
the kernel at first.

I don't think we should wait for user space to clean that up but have to
do it automatically from the kernel. Maybe we can introduce a special
value that basically NOPs the transmission. The hash table itself would
install a netdevice notifier and would clean all tables. Could
definitely cause some storm in the kernel, if a lot of keys are mapped
to the same interface.

I am leaning more towards deleting it automatically. But walking all
tables and in there all keys might cause some unwanted load spikes.

A separate type for ifindex as key or value might be nice to expose this
information directly via the kernel (fdinfo etc.) but at the same time,
debugging infrastructure from user space can also easily deal with that.

Another approach would be:

ifindexes are allocated cyclic and also are signed int and not u32
during allocation. Maybe we can negate the ifindex during transmission
in the table and thus mark it as stale (or set it to -1)? This update
would be done by bpf_tx_*ports() that take a reference to a table and a
key and submit the packets on the appropriate ports and can flag the
relevant ifindexes as stale.

Just wanted to draft this idea, I am not particular happy with that
idea. Maybe someone comes up with a better one.

Thanks,
Hannes
