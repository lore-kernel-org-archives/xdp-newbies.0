I fully agree that we need some way to express capabilities[1]

I fully agree that we need some control structure to XDP programs.  My
previous attempt was shot-down due to performance concerns of an extra
pointer dereference. As I explained before, this is not a concern as
the dereference will happen once per N packets in the NAPI loop.

Plus now we see a need to elide things based on facilities the XDP
program choose to use/enable, for performance reasons.  I would prefer
keeping these facility settings in control structure to XDP programs,
instead of pulling in derived bits runtime.   Again remember, adding
if/branch statements checking for facilities, should have little
performance impact as the branch predictor should guess correctly given
we process N packets in the NAPI loop with same facilities.
