This return API is not about optimizing performance right now.  It is
actually about allowing us to change the underlying memory model per RX
queue for XDP.

If a RX-ring is use for both SKBs and XDP, then the refcnt model is
still enforced.  Although a driver using the 1-packet-per-page model,
should be able to reuse refcnt==1 pages when returned from XDP.

If a RX-ring is _ONLY_ used for XDP, then the driver have freedom to
implement another memory model, with the return-API.  We need to
experiment with the most optimal memory model.  The 1-packet-per-page
model is actually not the fastest, because of PCI-e bottlenecks.  With
HW support for packing descriptors and packets over the PCI-e bus, much
higher rates can be achieved.  Mellanox mlx5-Lx already have the needed HW
support.  And companies like NetCope also have 100G HW that does
similar tricks, and they even have a whitepaper[1][2] how they are
faster than DPDK with their NDP (Netcope Data Plane) API.

We do need the ability/flexibility to change the RX memory model, to
take advantage of this new NIC hardware.
