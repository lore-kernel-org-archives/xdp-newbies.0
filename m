no. i'm suggesting to store in per-cpu scratch area just like cls_bpf does.

yes. since 'ifindex' needs to be part of xdp_md struct in read-only way.
Just like in cls_bpf does it.
Otherwise if we attach the same program to multiple taps it won't
know which tap the traffic arriving on and won't be able to redirect properly.

It's not about like or dont-like per-cpu scratch area.
My main point: it works just fine for cls_bpf and i'm suggesting to do
the same for xdp_redirect, since no one ever complained about that bit of cls_bpf.

exactly. arriving ifindex is independent of xdp_redirect helper.

exactly. I'm saying the same thing.
I'm not sure which part of my proposal was so confusing.
Sorry about that.
