no. the hard fail will be wrong, since verifier is conservative.
As i showed in the example with variable ip hdr length.

yes. I was thinking as an optimization. If verifier can see that
prog needs only 20 bytes of headroom or no headroom (like netronome
already does) than the ring can be configured differently for hopefully
better performance.
But that's probably bad idea, since I was assuming that such ring
reconfiguration can be made fast, which is unlikely.
If it takes seconds to setup a ring, then drivers should just
assume XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM, since at that time the program
properties are unknown and in the future other programs will be loaded.
Take a look at our current setup with slots for xdp_dump, ddos, lb
programs. Only root program is attached at the begining.
If the driver configures the ring for such empty program that would break
dynamic addition of lb prog.
The driver must not interrupt the traffic when user adds another
prog to prog array. In such case XDP side doesn't even know that
prog array is used. It's all happening purely on bpf side.

are you talking hw offloaded prog or normal in-driver xdp?

what is an example of what you proposing? How will it look from user pov?
