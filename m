I agree with both of you on all of these points.  Having the port
redirection in a new type of map and/or array seems like the way to go.

I understood Jesper's perspecitive when thinking about a way to pass a
port-table id down, but I think the idea that the userspace loader code
defining the maps is going to be the one making this link is the right
idea and handling things like ifindex changes (rather than identifiers
that perform lookups in other tables) is going to have to be yet another
exercise left up to the...user.  :-)
