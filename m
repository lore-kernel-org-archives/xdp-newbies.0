The concrete reason for an "unified" return code is to simplify changes
needed in the drivers.  The purpose is moving code out of the drivers
into the core.  IMHO we should keep drivers as simple as possible and
stop adding more return action codes. XDP_REDIRECT combined with a
port-table should be the last action-code needed in the drivers.
As the port table will know the "type" of the port.

Keeping action XDP_DROP and XDP_TX inside the drivers make sense,
because it allow for driver level optimizations. Actions that want to
transfer the packet/xdp_buff "outside" the driver should call a core
function (given it will be called with the xdp_buff struct, you can
hide all your extra extensions there without changing the driver code).
