If I understand correctly that the current proposal is to:

1. Assume program needs 256 (XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM) of prepend.
2. Make verifier try to lower that through byte code analysis.
3. Make the load fail if (prog->max_prepend > driver->xdp_max_prepend).

Would that not cause unnecessary load failures?  I'm worried it would
force users to do things like this:

struct map_value *val;

if (val->prep_len > 64) /* Prove to verifier this is short */
	return XDP_DROP;
if (xdp_adjust_head(xdp, -val->prep_len))
	...

Or worse not do that, use Qlogic, Broadcom, Mellanox or Netronome cards
and then be in for a nasty surprise when they try to load the same
program for Intel parts :(

I agree that trying to express capabilities to user space is quickly
going to become more confusing than helpful.  However, I think here we
need the opposite - we need an opt-in way of program requesting
guarantees about the datapath.

We may expect most users won't care and we may want to still depend on
the verifier to analyze the program and enable optimizations, but
depending on the verifier for proving prepend lengths is scary.  Or are
we just discussion the optimizations here and not the guarantees about
headroom availability?
