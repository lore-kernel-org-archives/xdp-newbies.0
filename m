If the capability is variable, it must be communicated to the user
somehow at program load time.

We are consistently finding that there is this real need to
communicate XDP capabilities, or somehow verify that the needs
of an XDP program can be satisfied by a given implementation.

Maximum headroom is just one.

Simply having bpf_xdp_adjust_head() fail and therefore drop packets
isn't good behavior at all.  But that is the situation we have
right now.

I don't think this is reasonable.  The amount of inconsistency will be
quite huge.

First of all, every driver pulls a different amount of bytes into the
linear area when building frag based SKBs on receive.  There are
drivers that only put the MAC header in the linear area, and depend
upon the logic in the stack which does pskb_may_pull() before touching
deeper headers.

Of course, such drivers should be using eth_get_headlen().  But they
don't, and what they are doing is not a bug.

And eth_get_headlen() only pulls protocol headers, which precludes XDP
inspecting anything below TCP/UDP/etc.  This is also not reasonable.

Right now, as it stands, we have to assume the program can potentially
be interested in the entire packet.

We can only optimize this and elide things when we have a facility in
the future for the program to express it's needs precisely.  I think
we will have to add some control structure to XDP programs that can
be filled in for this purpose.

Right now the two things we know would need to be expressed are 1)
maximum headroom needed and 2) parsing depth.  I'm not %100 clear on
how #2 should be specified, but in it's simplest sense it could take
on two values, either "what eth_get_headlen() returns" or "entire
packet" to start with.

Ok, this makes sense.  I'll work on that.

I'm not so sure how I feel about checksums, I've been busy following
the thread started by Tom.  I want to strive for something simple.

I'll try to accomplish what I can today...
