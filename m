I didn't see this part, now it all makes sense why ldimm64 is used
and I therefore think we should keep it this way.

I just explained it in that paragraph above :-)

struct bpf_map_def SEC("maps") jmp_table __attribute__((map)) = {

And when referenced by an instruction the bpf gcc backend can see that
the "map" attribute is set and emit the appropriate %map() string into
the assembler.

We can even make the special map attribute do the SEC("") part too.

I think it is better to have real objects for introspection (even
after session is complete) and for testing under simulators (one of
which I plan to write).

And if we linked a real final static object, elf header would be all
that would be needed to find execution entry point.
