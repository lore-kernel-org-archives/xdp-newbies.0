I am not sure how the socket interface should look like, it seems to be
too far away to me right now.

Regarding having stable ifindexes, I wonder if we could do something:

int ifindexes_in_use_by_ebpf_program[] __section("ifindex") = {
1,2,3,8,9,10 };

and we can make sure that the ifindexes automatically stay stable for
the lifetime while the ebpf program is loaded?

Bye,
Hannes
