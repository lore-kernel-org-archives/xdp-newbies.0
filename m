The above descrption is correct. Also note that the offset within the packet
can be a variable as well, since that's the only way to do variable
length parsing (like ip options), so the verifier cannot tell how far
into the packet the program is going to parse. The program author cannot
tell that either!
Consider samples/bpf/parse_varlen.c:
        ihl_len = iph->ihl * 4;

        if (iph->protocol == IPPROTO_IPIP) {
                iph = data + nh_off + ihl_len;
                if (iph + 1 > data_end)
                        return 0;

'ihl' is 4 bit, so 2nd ip hdr may start at sizeof(eth) + 64 bytes,
but we cannot ask the driver to always provide these many bytes.
Technically we can add a feature to verifier to calculate the max range
into the packet that the program may look at, but it will be large.
Like if the program parses IPIP the range will be 64(first ip) + 64(second ip)
+ 64 (if it looks at tcp options).
If the program parses TLVs then the range will be 64k, so I'm not sure what
would be the value of such verifier feature.
