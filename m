For TC I guess it is fine to keep it as is, because it is needed to
avoid extending skb.  IHMO for XDP I see no reason to keep a
per-cpu-store (which besides will be slower), simply update
xdp_buff.port should be sufficient (which is only relevant for this
packet).

As noted in option#3, my concern is that calling a helper function call
will be slower, than simply returning the needed port info? 

Maybe some bpf experts can tell me if such helper call could be
optimized out with some bpf magic?

Nope, it will be extensible.

We can start with:

 struct xdp_ret {
     union {
         __u32 act;
         struct {
             __u16 action;
             __u16 port;
         };
 };

And later change it to:

 struct xdp_ret {
     union {
         __u32 act;
         struct {
             __u8  action;
             __u8  flags;
             __u16 port;
         };
 };

If actions does not go above 255.  I would prefer that we start with
the latter, else people would argue that we need to extend the
structure like:

 struct xdp_ret {
     union {
         __u32 act;
         struct {
             union {
                 __u16 action;
                 struct {
                     __u8 action2;
                     __u8 flags;
                 };
             };
             __u16 port;
         };
 };
