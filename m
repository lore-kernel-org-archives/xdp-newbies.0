I like the idea.
We have prog_array, perf_event_array, cgroup_array map specializations.
This one can be new netdev_array with some new bpf_redirect-like helper
accessing it.

this is great idea. Once BPF_MAP_TYPE_NETDEV_ARRAY is populated
the user space can make it readonly to prevent further changes.

 From user space it can be done similar to perf_events/cgroups as well.
bpf_map_update_elem(&netdev_array, &port_num, &ifindex)
should work.
For bpf_map_lookup_elem() from such netdev_array we can return
ifindex back.
The bpf_map_show_fdinfo() can be customized as well to pretty print
ifindexes of netdevs stored in there.
