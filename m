Fully agree, such an extension is likely to be used wrongly or with
some default size as we have right now with XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM to
cover most use cases in order to not bother the user to deal with
this resp. not to complicate things more.

+1, we should try hard to reuse such information from the verifier
to determine specific requirements the program has, and check against
them at prog attach time. This works okay so far for the already
mentioned bits in struct bpf_prog, and could be further extended.
