Is there a concrete reason that all the proposed future cases like sockets
have to be handled within the very same XDP_REDIRECT return code? F.e. why
not XDP_TX_NIC that only assumes ifindex as proposed in the patch, and future
ones would get a different return code f.e. XDP_TX_SK only handling sockets
when we get there implementation-wise?
