I think so too.
Once netdevice is stored into netdev_array map the netdevice is pinned
and we need to figure out what to do if somebody tries to delete it.
Should we add a new netlink notifier that this netdev's refcnt is
almost zero and it's only in netdev_array(s) ?
or should it be deleted from the array(s) automatically and
then user space will be notified post-deletion?
Both approaches have their pros and cons.

Whereas raw ifindex approach (via bpf_redirect) doesn't have these
caveats. It's clear to both bpf prog and user space that ifindex
can be stale and user space needs to monitor netdevs and update
programs/maps.
